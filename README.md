* [SCAMP](http://scamp.marcevanstein.com/#)  SCAMP is an computer-assisted composition framework in Python designed to act as a hub, flexibly connecting the composer-programmer to a wide variety of resources for playback and notation. SCAMP allows the user to manage the flow of musical time, play notes either using [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) or via MIDI or OSC messages to an external synthesizer, and ultimately quantize and export the result to music notation in the form of MusicXML or Lilypond. Overall, the framework aims to address pervasive technical challenges while imposing as little as possible on the aesthetic choices of the composer-programmer.
